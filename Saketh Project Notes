What is the DHS?
{
  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) protects our country's borders and manages the flow   of people and products into and out of the United States. The DHS helps our country by: helping when disaster strikes, protecting the economy, protecting the borers of the country, making sure our cyber space and critical infrastructure is secure, and preventing terrorism/ homeland attacks.
}

What is cloud computing?
{
  Cloud computing is the use of online computing services on a pay-as-you-go basis instead of having on site inventory and data servers. The advantages to the cloud is that it is easily scalable up or down. There is no need for on site data structures as it can be handled online by offsite providers. 
}

Cloud computing types
{
  There are 3 types of cloud computing: public, private, and hybrid. Public is when there are no on site data structures, the cloud infrastructure is open to everyone in public, and most of the infrastructure is online. Private is when the cloud structure is only owned by a single organization and there are data structures on-site. Hybrid is a mix of both other types.
